Water effect for KWin/KDE4.

Questions and bugs to: Michal Srb <michalsrb@gmail.com>

This effect depends on OpenGL and its GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension.
If you do not see any waves, it can be because your graphics card (or driver) doesn't support this extension.

This is 0.0.1 version - first introduction and test.
Take it like a demo, far from final product.
I plan to add more options and more useful things, e.q. Wave notification feature..

..and be tolerant to my English, thanks. ;-)
