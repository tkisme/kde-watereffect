Requirements
============

Cmake, build tools.

Developing files for: KDE4 - base/workspace, KDE4 - lib, QT4 and OpenGL.
(For example packages: kdebase-workspace-dev, kdelibs5-dev, libqt4-dev and mesa-common-dev in Ubuntu.)


Building
========

1) Enter directory where to place build files.
For example in build directory in watereffect directory:

$ cd watereffect-0.0.1
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

2) Configure.
Watereffect use Cmake as well as whole KDE. In fact I used some CMakeLists.txt from KDE and I hope this effect will be added to the official effects in future.
So, run cmake in your build folder, argument it and point it to the source (upper dir):

$cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$( kde4-config --prefix ) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..

4) Finally build.
Unexpectedly:

$ make


Install
=======

Usually you need to be root to install files into /usr* directories..

# make install


Cleanup
=======

You can delete temporary files by 'make clean', alternatively delete whole build directory.


Run
===

Now there should be new item in your kwin effects settings. If not, try run kbuildsycoca (or kbuildsycoca4) that KDE learned about the new .desktop files.
To see new effect in action, restart kwin. Run:
$ kwin --replace


Have a fun.
